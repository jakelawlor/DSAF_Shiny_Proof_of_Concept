# Prototype Shiny App

This repository contains data, processing scripts, and application scripts for the DSAF prototype shiny application, using six indicators of species' distribution change for assessing trends across jurisdictional boundaries.

This application is a *prototype*, meant to aid in discussions for further development. Data contained in this application are hypothetical, and should not be used for analysis, interpretation, or decision-making. 

A hosted version of the application can be found [here](https://jakelawlor.shinyapps.io/HalibutRangeShifts/)
